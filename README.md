        â””â”€â”€ package.xml
```

## 1.1 Defining a Service

A service is declared using a `.srv` file in ROS2. This tells both the server & client what data is being sent and returned during communication. It is composed of two parts:
1. A request, which defines what data the client will send, and
2. A response, which defines what the server will return:

```
# Request
package/Type request
---
# Response
package/Type response
```
Both the request and response fields can be composed of any number of fields and data types.

### 1.1.1. Create the Service File

In `srv/Haiku.srv` we will request the line number, and in return the server will return a `std_msgs::msg::String` object:
```
int64 line_number
---
std_msgs/String line
```

### 1.1.2 Edit the Configuration Files

ROS2 will convert the `.srv` service definition in to useable code. We must give it instructions to do so in the `CMakeLists.txt` file:
```
find_package(rclcpp REQUIRED)
find_package(rosidl_default_generators REQUIRED)
find_package(std_msgs)

```
We need:
- `rclcpp` for the ROS2 C++ client libraries,
- `rosidl_default_generators` to tell it how to build the `.srv` file in to useable code, and
- `std_msgs` which contains the `String` field
  
Then beneath it we add:
```
rosidl_generate_interfaces(${PROJECT_NAME} "srv/Haiku.srv"
                           DEPENDENCIES std_msgs)
```
which then tells ROS2 to compile the file we just created under the current project name.

Simultaneously we must modify the `package.xml` file to match:
```
<depend>rclcpp</depend>
<depend>std_msgs</depend>
<build_depend>rosidl_default_generators</build_depend>
<exec_depend>rosidl_default_runtime</exec_depend>
<member_of_group>rosidl_interface_packages</member_of_group>
```

### 1.2.3 Compile & Inspect the Service

Navigate to the ROS2 working directory:
```
cd ~/ros2_workspace
```
then build the package:
```
colcon build --packages-select tutorial_ros2
```
Make sure you source the changes if you haven't added this to your `.bashrc` file:
```
source ./install.setup.bash
```
Now we can check the details of the newly defined service:
```
ros2 interface show tutorial_ros2/srv/Haiku
```
