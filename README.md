        â”œâ”€â”€ CMakeLists.txt
        â””â”€â”€ package.xml
```

## 1 Defining an Action

Communication between an action server and client is defined by a `.action` file:
```
package/Type goal
---
package/Type result
---
package/Type feedback
```
It contains three parts:
1. A goal component providing data about what the server should achieve,
2. A result component providing data on the outcome of the action, and
3. Feedback that provides regular updates as the action is executing.

The goal & response function similarly to the client & service protocol, whereas the feedback will quite literally be published like the publisher protocol.

Whilst a service should provide a near-instantaneous response, an action should be used when a request will take several seconds or more to complete.

### 1.1 Create the Action File :card_index:

Create the file `action/Haiku.action` and insert the following code:
```
int32 number_of_lines
---
std_msgs/String poem
---
int32 line_number
std_msgs/String current_line
```
- The goal for the action is to read a given `number_of_lines` of an haiku.
- The result will be a `std_msgs/String` of the entire number of lines, and
- The feedback will be the current `line_number` and the `current_line`.


[:arrow_up: Back to top.](#action-servers--action-clients)

### 1.2 Edit the Configuration Files :hammer_and_wrench:

We need to edit the configuration files so the compiler knows to turn the `.action` definition in to useable code.

First add the following to  `CMakeLists.txt`:
```
find_package(std_msgs REQUIRED)
find_package(rosidl_default_generators REQUIRED)
```
- We need `std_msgs` for the `std_msgs/String` in `Haiku.action`,
- We need the `rosidl_default_generators` for converting the `.action` in to code.

Now we need to update the `package.xml` file to match. First add these:
```
<depend>std_msgs</depend>
<depend>action_msgs</depend>
```
Here we need the additional `action_msgs` not found in the `CMakeLists.txt` file. Then add:
```
<build_depend>rosidl_default_generators</build_depend>
<member_of_group>rosidl_interface_packages</member_of_group>
```

[:arrow_up: Back to top.](#action-servers--action-clients)

### 1.3 Compile & Inspect the Action :computer:

Navigate back to the root of your ROS2 workspace `cd ~/ros2_workspace` then build the package:
```
colcon build --packages-select tutorial_ros2
```
Make sure to source the changes if you haven't already told `.bashrc` to do so:
```
source ./install/setup.bash
```
Now we can check that it has compiled correctly with:
```
ros2 interface show tutorial_ros2/action/Haiku
```
which should print the following:
<p align="center">
  <img src="doc/interface_show_action.png" width="700" height="auto" alt="Screenshot of ros2 interface show for Haiku action."/>
  <br>
  <em> Figure 1: ROS2 showing the action definition for the Haiku with the goal, result, and feedback fields.</em>
</p>

## 2 Creating an Action Server

### 2.1 Create the Header File :page_facing_up:

It is good practice in C++ to separate the declarations (such as classes, functions, etc.) from the source code. This can improve compile times in large projects.

Create the file `include/HaikuActionServer.h` and insert the following code:
```
#ifndef HAIKU_ACTION_SERVER_H
#define HAIKU_ACTION_SERVER_H

#include "rclcpp/rclcpp.hpp"
#include "rclcpp_action/rclcpp_action.hpp"
#include "std_msgs/msg/string.hpp"
#include "tutorial_ros2/action/haiku.hpp"

class HaikuActionServer : public rclcpp::Node
{
    using Haiku = tutorial_ros2::action::Haiku;
    using HaikuGoalHandle = rclcpp_action::ServerGoalHandle<Haiku>;
    
    public:

        HaikuActionServer(const std::string &nodeName    = "haiku_action_server",
                          const std::string &serviceName = "haiku_action");
                          
    private:
    
        rclcpp_action::Server<Haiku>::SharedPtr _actionServer;

        rclcpp_action::GoalResponse
        handle_goal(const rclcpp_action::GoalUUID      &uuid,
                    std::shared_ptr<const Haiku::Goal> goal);

        void
        handle_accepted(const std::shared_ptr<HaikuGoalHandle> goalHandle);
        
        void
        execute(const std::shared_ptr<HaikuGoalHandle> goalHandle);

        rclcpp_action::CancelResponse
        handle_cancel(const std::shared_ptr<HaikuGoalHandle> goalHandle)
        {
             (void)goalHandle;
             
             RCLCPP_INFO(rclcpp::get_logger("haiku_action_server"),"Received cancellation request.");
            
             return rclcpp_action::CancelResponse::ACCEPT;
        }
        
};
#endif
```
Some of the more important lines of code to consider are:
- `#include "rclcpp_action/rclcpp_action.h"`: This contains the C++ libraries for ROS2 actions,
- `#include "tutorial_ros2/action/haiku.hpp"`: This enables us to use `Haiku.action` that we built in the same package,
- `class HaikuActionServer : public rclcpp::Node`: This class builds upon a ROS2 node along with all its functionality.
- `rclcpp_action::Server<Haiku>::SharedPtr _actionServer;`: This object is responsible for communicating with a client over ROS2.

There are also 4 methods:
1. `handle_goal(...)`: This will receive and process a request from an action client,
2. `handle_accepted(...)`: This is an intermediary method that can be used to prepare the class to execute an action.
3. `execute(...)`: Is where the action is carried out, and
4. `handle_cancel(...)`: Will process any cancellation request.

[:arrow_up: Back to top.](#action-servers--action-clients)

### 2.2 Create the Source File :page_facing_up:

#### Insert Headers :headstone:

Now create the `src/HaikuActionServer.cpp` file and insert this line at the top:
```
#include <HaikuActionServer.h>
```
which essentially inserts the header file and class declaration.

#### Insert the Constructor :building_construction:

```
HaikuActionServer::HaikuActionServer(const std::string &nodeName,
                                     const std::string &actionName)
                                     : Node(nodeName)
{
    using namespace std::placeholders;
    
    _actionServer = rclcpp_action::create_server<tutorial_ros2::action::Haiku>
    (
        this,
        actionName,
        std::bind(&HaikuActionServer::handle_goal,     this, _1, _2),
        std::bind(&HaikuActionServer::handle_cancel,   this, _1),
        std::bind(&HaikuActionServer::handle_accepted, this, _1)
    );
    
    RCLCPP_INFO(this->get_logger(),
                "Started '%s` action server. Advertising '%s' action.",
                nodeName.c_str(), actionName.c_str());
}
```
The lines proceeeding `_actionServer = ...` has many important components:
1. It uses a template argument `<tutorial_ros2::action::Haiku>` which tells it what the goal, result, and feedback data is,
2. `this` refers to the `rclcpp::Node` inherited by the `HaikuActionServer` class,
3. `actionName` is what will be advertised over the ROS2 network,
4. Then we use `std::bind` to attach the 3 methods needed to process & run an action.

#### Insert Goal Handling :goal_net:

```
rclcpp_action::GoalResponse
HaikuActionServer::handle_goal(const rclcpp_action::GoalUUID      &uuid,
                               std::shared_ptr<const Haiku::Goal> goal)
{
    (void)uuid;
    
    RCLCPP_INFO(this->get_logger(), "Received action request.");
    
    if(goal->number_of_lines < 1)
    {
        RCLCPP_WARN(this->get_logger(), "Requested number of lines was less than 1.");
        
        return rclcpp_action::GoalResponse::REJECT;
    }
    else
    {
        return rclcpp_action::GoalResponse::ACCEPT_AND_EXECUTE;
    }
}
```
This doesn't require much explanation. It checks that the number of lines is a positive integer, and accepts or rejects.

We use `(void)uuid` to stop colcon from issuing a warning when we build. But we could use this for other purposes.

For example, we could add a class member to keep track of active goals:
```
std::unordered_map<rclcpp_action::GoalUUID, std::shared_ptr<GoalHandleHaiku>> _activeGoals;
```
then check inside this method if it is already running:
```
if (_activeGoals.find(uuid) != _activeGoals.end())
{
    RCLCPP_WARN(get_logger(), "Duplicate goal received. Rejecting.");
    return rclcpp_action::GoalResponse::REJECT;
}
```

#### Insert Goal Acceptance :open_hands:

```
void
HaikuActionServer::handle_accepted(const std::shared_ptr<HaikuGoalHandle> goalHandle)
{
    std::thread{std::bind(&HaikuActionServer::execute, this, std::placeholders::_1), goalHandle}.detach();
}
```
This immediately generates a separate thread to run the `execute` method, using the `goalHandle` as an argument.

Although it is not used much here, the `handle_accepted` method is where preparations should be made for an action; saving certain parameters, performing necessary calculations, etc.

Following the example above, this would be where we add this to the active goal list:
```
_activeGoals[goalHandle->get_goal_id()] = goalHandle;
```

#### Insert Action Execution :gear:

```
void
HaikuActionServer::execute(const std::shared_ptr<HaikuGoalHandle> goalHandle)
{
    RCLCPP_INFO(this->get_logger(), "Reading you a haiku.");
    
    Haiku::Feedback::SharedPtr feedback = std::make_shared<Haiku::Feedback>();
    
    Haiku::Result::SharedPtr result = std::make_shared<Haiku::Result>();
    
    result->poem.data = "\n";
    
    rclcpp::Rate loopRate(1);
    
    int counter = 1;
    
    for(int i = 0; i < goalHandle->get_goal()->number_of_lines and rclcpp::ok(); ++i)
    {
        feedback->line_number = i+1;
        
        switch(counter)
        {
            case 1:
            {
                feedback->current_line.data = "Worker bees can leave.\n";
                break;
            }
            case 2:
            {
                feedback->current_line.data = "Even drones can fly away.\n";
                break;
            }
            case 3:
            {
                feedback->current_line.data = "The Queen is their slave.\n";
                break;
            }
        }
        
        result->poem.data += feedback->current_line.data;
        
        if(counter < 3) ++counter;
        else            counter = 1;

        if(goalHandle->is_canceling())
        {
            goalHandle->canceled(result);
            
            RCLCPP_INFO(this->get_logger(), "Reading cancelled at line %d", i+1);
        }
        
        goalHandle->publish_feedback(feedback);
        
        loopRate.sleep();
    }

    if(rclcpp::ok())
    {
        goalHandle->succeed(result);

        RCLCPP_INFO(rclcpp::get_logger("haiku_action_server"), "Finished reading the haiku.");
    }
}
```
With these 2 lines we create pointers to the `result` and `feedback` portions of the `Haiku.action`:
```
Haiku::Feedback::SharedPtr feedback = std::make_shared<Haiku::Feedback>();
Haiku::Result::SharedPtr result = std::make_shared<Haiku::Result>();
```
This allows us to manipulate the data within them.

Inside this loop we simply check the line number and add the appropriate line of the haiku:
```
for(int i = 0; i < goalHandle->get_goal()->number_of_lines and rclcpp::ok(); ++i)
{
  ...
}
```
Two important components:
1. We insert updates with `feedback->` and then publish it with `goalHandle->publish_feedback(feedback)`, exactly as a standard publisher would.
2. We insert the result of the goal with `result->`, and send it back upon completion with `goalHandle->succeed(result)` or `goalHandle->canceled(result)`.

The lines `rclcpp::Rate loopRate(1);` and `loopRate.sleep()` are used to regulate the timing of the feedback publisher to 1Hz.

#### Add Cancellation Method :stop_sign:

```
rclcpp_action::CancelResponse
HaikuActionServer::handle_cancel(const std::shared_ptr<HaikuGoalHandle> goalHandle)
{
     (void)goalHandle;
     
     RCLCPP_INFO(rclcpp::get_logger("haiku_action_server"),"Received cancellation request.");
    
     return rclcpp_action::CancelResponse::ACCEPT;
}
```
This will automatically cancel.

If we were keeping track of multiple goals we could check to see if it exists and respone accordingly:
```
if (_activeGoals.find(goalHandle->get_goal_id()) == _activeGoals.end())
{
  // Do something appropriate here
}
```
Or we might use `goalHandle->get_status()` to see if it's an appropriate time to interrupt the action.

[:arrow_up: Back to top.](#action-servers--action-clients)

### 2.3 Create the Executable :gear:

Create the file `src/action_server.cpp` and insert this code:
```
#include <HaikuActionServer.h>

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    rclcpp::init(argc, argv);
    
    auto haikuActionServer = std::make_shared<HaikuActionServer>("haiku_action_server", "haiku_action");
    
    rclcpp::executors::SingleThreadedExecutor executor;
    executor.add_node(haikuActionServer);
    executor.spin();
    
    rclcpp::shutdown();
    
    return 0;  
}
```
We start ROS2 with `rclcpp::init(argc, argv)`.

In this line we:
```
auto haikuActionServer = std::make_shared<HaikuActionServer>("haiku_action_server", "haiku_action");
```
- We make a shared pointer using to an instance of the class using the template argument `<HaikuActionServer>`,
- Give it the name `haiku_action_server` that will be seen on the ROS2 network, and
- Advertise the action as `haiku_action`.

In these 3 lines of code we:
```
rclcpp::executors::SingleThreadedExecutor executor;
executor.add_node(haikuActionServer);
executor.spin();
```
1. Create an executor that will run the nodes,
2. Attach our action server to it, and
3. Spin it indefinitely.

The advantage to this approach for code is that we could create _multiple_ action servers and run them simultaneously:
```
rclcpp::executors::MultiThreadedExecutor executor;
executor.add_node(actionServer1);
executor.add_node(actionServer2);
executor.add_node(actionServer3);
executor.spin();
```

[:arrow_up: Back to top.](#action-servers--action-clients)

### 2.4 Edit the Configuration Files :hammer_and_wrench:

Now we need to modify the `CMakeLists.txt` file to tell it to build our new executable. First we need to tell it to include header files:
```
include_directories(
    include
    ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/rosidl_generator_cpp)
```
The `rosidl_generator_cpp` line is referring to the location for the `tutorial_ros2/action/Haiku.hpp` files that ROS2 creates.

We also need to ensure it can locate the necessary packages:
```
find_package(rclcpp REQUIRED)
find_package(rclcpp_action REQUIRED)
find_package(${PROJECT_NAME} REQUIRED)
```
- `rclcpp` is the ROS2 C++ client libraries,
- `rclcpp_action` is the associated action libraries, and
- `${PROJECT_NAME}$` is referring to `tutorial_ros2` where we compiled `Haiku.action`.

Now toward the bottom we add:
```
add_executable(action_server src/action_server.cpp src/HaikuActionServer.cpp
)
```
- `action_server` is the name that will appear in the package when we use `ros2 run`, and
- We list the source files which contain all the necessary code.

Next we list dependencies:
```
ament_target_dependencies(action_server
    "rclcpp"
    "rclcpp_action"
    "std_msgs"
    ${PROJECT_NAME}
)
```
This matches the `find_package` commands higher up in the file.

Now we tell it to install so ROS2 can find it:
```
install(TARGETS action_server
        DESTINATION lib/${PROJECT_NAME})
```

[:arrow_up: Back to top.](#action-servers--action-clients)

### 2.5 Compiling & Running the Package :computer:

Go back to the root of your ROS2 workspace, e.g. `cd ~/ros2_workspace` and compile the project:
```
colcon build --packages-select tutorial_ros2
```
Make sure to source the code if you haven't modified your `.bashrc` file:
```
source ./install/setup.bash
```
Now run the action server:
```
ros2 run tutoral_ros2 action_server
```

<p align="center">
  <img src = "doc/run_action_server.png" width="700" height="auto" alt="Screenshot of the action server running."/>
  <br>
  <em> Figure 2: The action server up and running.</em>
</p>

We can use `ros2 node list` and `ros2 action list` to see that the node exists and the action is advertised publicly:

<p align="center">
  <img src = "doc/node_action_list.png" width="400" height="auto" alt="Screenshot of node list and action list."/>
  <br>
  <em> Figure 3: The node and action can be seen publicly on the ROS2 network.</em>
</p>

Note that the names match what we assigned in the constructor arguments in the `action_server.cpp` file.

The server will advertise the feedback over a _hidden_ topic. We need to use:
```
ros2 topic list --include-hidden-topics
```
to actually see it.

<p align="center">
  <img src="doc/include_hidden_topics" width="600" height="auto" alt="Screenshot of hidden topic list.">
  <br>
  <em>Figure 4: Feedback topics from the server are hidden. </em>
</p>

## 3 Creating an Action Client

The client is responsible for generating & coordinating goals. Action servers denote discrete tasks to be achieved, and the client should be used to coordinate them to achieve more sophisticated, multi-task objectives.

### 3.1 Create the Header File :page_facing_up:

As before, we are going to separate the declaration for our class from the actual source code. Create `include/HaikuActionClient.h` and insert the following code:
```
#ifndef HAIKU_ACTION_CLIENT_H
#define HAIKU_ACTION_CLIENT_H

#include "rclcpp/rclcpp.hpp"
#include "rclcpp_action/rclcpp_action.hpp"
#include "std_msgs/msg/string.hpp"
#include "tutorial_ros2/action/haiku.hpp"

class HaikuActionClient : public rclcpp::Node
{
    using GoalStatus = action_msgs::msg::GoalStatus;
    using Haiku = tutorial_ros2::action::Haiku;
    using HaikuGoalHandle = rclcpp_action::ClientGoalHandle<Haiku>;
    
    public:

        HaikuActionClient(const std::string &nodeName   = "haiku_action_client",
                          const std::string &actionName = "haiku_action");

    private:

        rclcpp_action::Client<Haiku>::SendGoalOptions _sendGoalOptions;
            
        rclcpp_action::Client<Haiku>::SharedPtr _actionClient;
        
        std::shared_ptr<HaikuGoalHandle> _activeGoalHandle;
        
        void
        get_user_input();
        
        void
        goal_response_callback(std::shared_ptr<HaikuGoalHandle> goalHandle);

        void
        feedback_callback(std::shared_ptr<HaikuGoalHandle> goalHandle,
                          std::shared_ptr<const Haiku::Feedback> feedback);
 
        void
        result_callback(const HaikuGoalHandle::WrappedResult &result);     
};
#endif
```
The important lines of code to consider are:
- `#include "tutorial_ros2/action/haiku.hpp"`: This allows us to actually use the code generated from the `Haiku.action` file.
- `class HaikuActionClient : public rclcpp::Node` Our server class will build upon a ROS2 node, using all its functionality.
- `rclcpp_action::Client<Haiku>::SendGoalOptions _sendGoalOptions;` This object will be used to bind the methods and callback functions for interacting with the server,
- `rclcpp_action::Client<Haiku>::SharedPtr _actionClient;` This is the object responsible for coordinating communicating with the server,
- `std::shared_ptr<HaikuGoalHandle> _activeGoalHandle;` This object is used to keep track of a goal that is being executed.
- `get_user_input()` will be the main method that runs inside this class.

Then we have 3 callback methods:
1. `goal_response_callback()` will receive the answer from the server when a goal is sent.
2. `feedback_callback()` is optional, but it will subscribe to the feedback topic from the server.
3. `result_callback()` gets the final message from the server when the action ends.

[:arrow_up: Back to top.](#action-servers--action-clients)

### 3.2 Create the Source File :page_facing_up:

No in `src/HaikuActionClient.cpp` we can elaborate on all the methods.

First put `#include "HaikuActionClient.h"` at the top. Then insert the following methods:

#### The Constructor :building_construction:

```
HaikuActionClient::HaikuActionClient(const std::string &nodeName,
                                     const std::string &actionName)
                                     : Node(nodeName)
{
    _actionClient = rclcpp_action::create_client<Haiku>(this,actionName);

    RCLCPP_INFO(this->get_logger(), "Waiting for `%s` action to be advertised...", actionName.c_str());
    
    if(not _actionClient->wait_for_action_server(std::chrono::seconds(5)))
    {
        RCLCPP_ERROR(this->get_logger(), "Waited 5 seconds and found nothing. Shutting down");

    }
    
    using namespace std::placeholders;
    
    _sendGoalOptions = rclcpp_action::Client<Haiku>::SendGoalOptions();
    _sendGoalOptions.result_callback = std::bind(&HaikuActionClient::result_callback, this, _1);
    _sendGoalOptions.feedback_callback = std::bind(&HaikuActionClient::feedback_callback, this, _1, _2);
    _sendGoalOptions.goal_response_callback = std::bind(&HaikuActionClient::goal_response_callback, this, _1);

}
```
In the constructor we first create an instance of the client:
```
_actionClient = rclcpp_action::create_client<Haiku>(this,actionName);
```
It takes:
1. The template argument `<Haiku>` (really `tutorial_ros2::action::Haiku`),
2. Using `this` node which it attaches to, and
3. The `actionName` we expect to be advertised by the server.

To prevent error, we wait for the action to be advertised:
```
if(not _actionClient->wait_for_action_server(std::chrono::seconds(5)))
{
  ...
}
```
Here we create an object for storing options:
```
_sendGoalOptions = rclcpp_action::Client<Haiku>::SendGoalOptions();
```
In the proceeding lines, we attach the feedback, result, and goal response methods. This ensures they are automatically executed when the server sends back information.

Lastly, we generate a thread that will run the `get_user_input()` method indefinitely:
```
std::thread(&HaikuActionClient::get_user_input, this).detach();
```

#### Get User Input ðŸ¤²

            // If input is not an integer, std::stoi will throw a runtime error
            // so we need to catch it here.
            try
            {
                numberOfLines = std::stoi(userInput);
            }

                    goal.number_of_lines = numberOfLines;
                    
                    _actionClient->async_send_goal(goal, _sendGoalOptions);
                }
                else if(status == GoalStatus::STATUS_ACCEPTED
                     or status == GoalStatus::STATUS_EXECUTING)
                {
                    RCLCPP_WARN(this->get_logger(), "Another action is currently running.");
                }
                else                                                                                // CANCELING
                {
                    RCLCPP_INFO(this->get_logger(), "Previous action currently canceling. Please wait.");
                }
            }
            else
            {
                RCLCPP_WARN(this->get_logger(), "Argument must be a positive integer.");
            }
        }
    }
}
```
This method is quite lengthy, but it bridges the user input (you) with the server itself.

We can read commands typed in the terminal using:
```
`std::getline(std::cin, userInput);`
```
We use:
```
uint8_t status = (_activeGoalHandle == nullptr) ? 0 : _activeGoalHandle->get_status();
```
to check the current state of any action that is running. That way we can tailor the response.

If you simply hit Enter (i.e. empty input), it is (eventually) processed as a cancellation request:
```
_actionClient->async_cancel_goal(_activeGoalHandle);
```

Otherwise, for a valid input, and if the server is not busy, we can send a goal:
```
_actionClient->async_send_goal(goal, _sendGoalOptions);
```
we attach the goal options that tells it what callback methods to use (we could have unique callbacks for different goals).

#### The Response Callback :leftwards_arrow_with_hook:
```
void
HaikuActionClient::goal_response_callback(std::shared_ptr<HaikuGoalHandle> goalHandle)
{
    if(not goalHandle)
    {
        RCLCPP_ERROR(this->get_logger(), "Goal was rejected by server.");
    }
    else
    {
        _activeGoalHandle = goalHandle;
        
        RCLCPP_INFO (this->get_logger(), "Goal was accepted by server. Waiting for the result.");
    }
}
```
When you send a goal to the server, it will decide whether to accept the goal or not. It will then send a response with which we can make further decisions.

If the server has accepted the goal, we keep track of it here by assigning it to our pointer member:
```
_activeGoalHandle = goalHandle;
```

> [!TIP]
> We could have multiple goals that we could keep track of with, for example, an unordered map:
> `std::unordered_map<rclcpp_action::GoalUUID, std::shared_ptr<GoalHandleHaiku>> _activeGoals;` and
> `_activeGoals[goalHandle->get_goal_id()] = goalHandle;`

#### Feedback :back:

```
void
HaikuActionClient::feedback_callback(std::shared_ptr<HaikuGoalHandle> goalHandle,
                                     std::shared_ptr<const Haiku::Feedback> feedback)
{
    (void)goalHandle;
    
    RCLCPP_INFO(this->get_logger(), "The current line number is %d: %s", feedback->line_number, feedback->current_line.data.c_str());
}
```

As the server runs, it will publish feedback to a hidden topic. We can directly subscribe to it here if we choose, and act on any relevant information.

In this method we're only printing the message. We need `(void)goalHandle` to prevent `colcon` from issuing a warning.

> [!TIP]
> If we are juggling multiple goals can use `goalHandle->get_goal_id()` to search a `std::unordered_map<rclcpp_action::GoalUUID, std::shared_ptr<HaikuGoalHandle>` using the `find(goalHandle->get_goal_id())`.

#### Result :end:
```
void
HaikuActionClient::result_callback(const HaikuGoalHandle::WrappedResult &result)
{
    switch (result.code)
    {
        case rclcpp_action::ResultCode::SUCCEEDED:
        {
            RCLCPP_INFO(this->get_logger(), "Here is the result:\n%s", result.result->poem.data.c_str());
            break;
        }
        case rclcpp_action::ResultCode::ABORTED:
        {
            RCLCPP_ERROR(this->get_logger(), "Action was aborted.");
            break;
        }
        case rclcpp_action::ResultCode::CANCELED:
        {
            RCLCPP_ERROR(this->get_logger(), "Action was canceled.");
            break;
        }
        default:
        {
            RCLCPP_ERROR(this->get_logger(), "Unknown result code (how did that happen?).");
            break;
        }
    }
    
    _activeGoalHandle = nullptr;
    
    RCLCPP_INFO(this->get_logger(), "Please enter a number > 0, or hit Enter to cancel.");
}
```
When the action is ended (either through cancellation, abortion, or completion), the server will send the result part of the `.action` definition. We receive it here and make use of it as appropriate.

In this specific example, we empty the pointer of the finished goal with:
```
_activeGoalHandle = nullptr;
```

### 3.3 Create the Executable :gear:

Now create `src/action_client.cpp` and insert this code:
```
#include <HaikuActionClient.h>

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    rclcpp::init(argc, argv);
    
    auto haikuActionClient = std::make_shared<HaikuActionClient>("haiku_action_client", "haiku_action");
    
    rclcpp::executors::SingleThreadedExecutor executor;
    executor.add_node(haikuActionClient);
    executor.spin();
    
    rclcpp::shutdown();
    
    return 0;  
}
```
In this code we start up ROS2 with `rclcpp::init(argc, argv);`.

We then create an instance of our class:
```
auto haikuActionClient = std::make_shared<HaikuActionClient>("haiku_action_client", "haiku_action");
```
The 2nd argument "haiku_action" must match the name advertised by the server.

Then we make an executor, add our node, and run it:
```
rclcpp::executors::SingleThreadedExecutor executor;
executor.add_node(haikuActionClient);
executor.spin();
```

Again, this extra `.cpp` file seems superfluous. We could merge the `HaikuAction.h` and `HaikuAction.cpp` to the top of this file. But having this modular design allows greater flexibility.

We could use an executor to run the server and client simultaneously:
```
auto haikuActionClient = std::make_shared<HaikuActionClient>("haiku_action_client", "haiku_action");
auto haikuActionServer = std::make_shared<HaikuActionServer>("haiku_action_server", "haiku_action");

rclcpp::executors::MultiThreadedExecutor executor;
executor.add_node(haikuActionServer);
executor.add_node(haikuActionClient);
executor.spin();
```
This guarantees the server is always available when the client starts up.

[:arrow_up: Back to top.](#action-servers--action-clients)

### 3.4 Edit the Configuration Files :hammer_and_wrench:

We need to edit the `CMakeLists.txt` file so ROS2 knows to build the new executable. Near the bottom add:
```
add_executable(action_client src/action_client.cpp src/HaikuActionClient.cpp
)
```
We will give it the name `action_client` which will be known to ROS2. We also list all the source files.

Underneath, list the packages that it is dependent on:
```
ament_target_dependencies(action_client
    "rclcpp"
    "rclcpp_action"
    "std_msgs"
    ${PROJECT_NAME}
)
```
The term `${PROJECT_NAME}` refers to `tutorial_ros2` in which we created the `Haiku.action` action.

Now tell the compiler to install it so ROS2 can actually find it:
```
install(TARGETS
        action_server
        action_client
        DESTINATION lib/${PROJECT_NAME})
```

[:arrow_up: Back to top.](#action-servers--action-clients)

### 3.5 Compiling & Running the Package :computer:

Navigate back to the root of your ROS2 workspace, e.g. `cd ~/ros2_workspace`, then build the package:
```
colcon build --packages-select tutorial_ros2
```
Don't forget to source the changes if you haven't modified your `.bashrc` file:
```
source ./install/setup.bash
```
Now you should be able to run the client:
```
ros2 run tutorial_ros2 action_client
```
