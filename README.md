## 1 Defining an Action

Communication between an action server and client is defined by a `.action` file:
```
package/Type goal
---
package/Type result
---
package/Type feedback
```
It contains three parts:
1. A goal component providing data about what the server should achieve,
2. A result component providing data on the outcome of the action, and
3. Feedback that provides regular updates as the action is executing.

The goal & response function similarly to the client & service protocol, whereas the feedback will quite literally be published like the publisher protocol.

Whilst a service should provide a near-instantaneous response, an action should be used when a request will take several seconds or more to complete.

### 1.1 Create the Action File :card_index:

Create the file `action/Haiku.action` and insert the following code:
```
int32 number_of_lines
---
std_msgs/String poem
---
int32 line_number
std_msgs/String current_line
```
- The goal for the action is to read a given `number_of_lines` of an haiku.
- The result will be a `std_msgs/String` of the entire number of lines, and
- The feedback will be the current `line_number` and the `current_line`.

### 1.2 Edit the Configuration Files :hammer_and_wrench:

We need to edit the configuration files so the compiler knows to turn the `.action` definition in to useable code.

First add the following to  `CMakeLists.txt`:
```
find_package(std_msgs REQUIRED)
find_package(rosidl_default_generators REQUIRED)
```
- We need `std_msgs` for the `std_msgs/String` in `Haiku.action`,
- We need the `rosidl_default_generators` for converting the `.action` in to code.

Now we need to update the `package.xml` file to match. First add these:
```
<depend>std_msgs</depend>
<depend>action_msgs</depend>
```
Here we need the additional `action_msgs` not found in the `CMakeLists.txt` file. Then add:
```
<build_depend>rosidl_default_generators</build_depend>
<member_of_group>rosidl_interface_packages</member_of_group>
```

### 1.3 Compile & Inspect the Action :computer:

Navigate back to the root of your ROS2 workspace `cd ~/ros2_workspace` then build the package:
```
colcon build --packages-select tutorial_ros2
```
Make sure to source the changes if you haven't already told `.bashrc` to do so:
```
source ./install/setup.bash
```
Now we can check that it has compiled correctly with:
```
ros2 interface show tutorial_ros2/action/Haiku
```
which should print the following:
<p align="center">
  <img src="doc/interface_show_action.png" width="600" height="auto" alt="Screenshot of ros2 interface show for Haiku action."/>
