The `Publisher` and `Subcriber` protocol is analogous to the role of a news agency, or book store. A printing press will publish magazines and/or books that are sent to a store. They are made publically available for people to purchase of their own volition. The type of data being communicated is fast, frequent, and numerous.

## 1.1 Creating a Publisher

### 1.1.1 Create the Header File :page_facing_up:

It is good practice in C++ to separate the declarations for functions and classes from the source code. This makes it more efficient for the computer to compile large projects.

ROS2 is also designed around the use of object-oriented programming (OOP). This is useful because we can:
1. Spawn multiple objects of the same type (e.g. multiple cameras in a single robot system), and
2. Launch multiple nodes within a single executable.

Inside of `include/HaikuPublisher.h` insert the following code:

```
#ifndef HAIKU_PUBLISHER_H
#define HAIKU_PUBLISHER_H

#include <rclcpp/rclcpp.hpp>
#include <std_msgs/msg/string.hpp>

class HaikuPublisher : public rclcpp::Node
{
    public:

        HaikuPublisher(const std::string &nodeName = "haiku_publisher",
                       const std::string &topicName = "haiku",
                       const int &milliseconds = 2000);
    private:
    
        unsigned int _lineNumber = 1;

        rclcpp::TimerBase::SharedPtr _timer;
        
        rclcpp::Publisher<std_msgs::msg::String>::SharedPtr _publisher;
                
        void timer_callback();
};

#endif
```

#### Inspecting the Code :mag:

The significant lines of code to consider are:
- `#include <rclcpp/rclcpp.hpp>`: The ROS2 C++ client library which provides all the necessary functionality.
- `class HaikuPublisher : public rclcpp::Node`: Or HaikuPublisher class inherits the ROS2 Node class, and all its functions (methods) and variables (members).
- `rclcpp::TimerBase::SharedPtr _timer`: This is used to regulate how often we publish messages.
- `rclcpp::Publisher<std_msgs::msg::String>::SharedPtr _publisher`: This object is directly responsible for publishing our message over the ROS2 network.
- `void timer_callback();` This will be combined with the `_timer` and perform the core work for this class.

### 1.1.2 Create the Source File :page_facing_up:

Inside the `src/HaikuPublisher.cpp` insert:
```
#include <HaikuPublisher.h>
#include <functional>
#include <chrono>

HaikuPublisher::HaikuPublisher(const std::string &nodeName,
                               const std::string &topicName,
                               const int &milliseconds)
                               : Node(nodeName)
{
    _publisher = this->create_publisher<std_msgs::msg::String>(topicName, 1);

    _timer = this->create_wall_timer(
        std::chrono::milliseconds(milliseconds),
        std::bind(&HaikuPublisher::timer_callback, this)
    );
    
    RCLCPP_INFO(this->get_logger(),
                "Created the '%s' node. Publishing to the '%s' topic name.",
                nodeName.c_str(), topicName.c_str());
}

void HaikuPublisher::timer_callback()
{
    std_msgs::msg::String message;

    if     (_lineNumber == 1) message.data = "Worker bees can leave.";
    else if(_lineNumber == 2) message.data = "Even drones can fly away.";
    else if(_lineNumber == 3) message.data = "The Queen is their slave.";
    
    RCLCPP_INFO(this->get_logger(), "Publishing line number %d.", _lineNumber);

    if(_lineNumber < 3) _lineNumber++;
    else                _lineNumber = 1;

    _publisher->publish(message);
}
```

##### _The Publisher:_

Inside the `HaikuPublisher()` constructor, we create the publisher obect:
```
_publisher = this->create_publisher<std_msgs::msg::String>(topicName, 1);
```
The core components in its creation are:
- `this->` refers to the `rclcpp::Node`, and is attaching the publisher object to it.
- The `<std_msgs::msg::String>` is a template argument, using a ROS string message type.
- The `topicName` argument is what will appear to other nodes on the ROS2 network.
- The `1` argument refers to the queue length for number of messages available at a time.

Any subscribers to this topic will:
1. Find and connect to the topic via a matching `topicName`, and
2. Require the same type of message template, in this case the `std_msgs::msg::String`.

##### _The Callback Method:_

The `_timer` creates a function that runs independently at its own frequency:
```
_timer = this->create_wall_timer(std::chrono::milliseconds(milliseconds), std::bind(&HaikuPublisher::timer_callback, this));
```
The important components in its creation are:
- `this->` referring to the `rclcpp::Node` inside the `HaikuPublisher` class,
- The `milliseconds` argument is the time it will take between repeating the code (inverse of frequency)
- The `std::bind` tells the timer to call the `timer_callback` method in the `HaikuPublisher` class, and
- The `this` argument is referring to this class; the `HaikuPublisher`.

Inside the `HaikuPublisher::timer_callback()` method we:
1. Create a message of the type `std_msgs::msg::String`, which matches the template argument when we created the publisher,
2. Assign content to the field `message.data = ...`, then
3. Make this available on the ROS2 network using `_publisher->publish(message)`.

### 1.1.3 Create the Executable :gear:

Now we create a C++ executable that ROS2 will actually run.

We create a new file in `src/publisher.cpp` and insert the code:
```
#include "HaikuPublisher.h"
#include "rclcpp/rclcpp.hpp"

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    rclcpp::init(argc, argv);
    
    auto haikuPublisher = std::make_shared<HaikuPublisher>("haiku_publisher", "haiku", 2000);

    rclcpp::executors::SingleThreadedExecutor executor;
    executor.add_node(haikuPublisher);
    executor.spin();
    
    rclcpp::shutdown();
    
    return 0;
}
```

#### Inspecting the Code :mag:

The line `rclcpp::init(argc,arv)` starts ROS2.

We instantiate a `HaikuPublisher` object using the line:
```
auto haikuPublisher = std::make_shared<HaikuPublisher>("haiku_publisher", "haiku", 2000);
```

Then, we create an executor which will run our node:
```
rclcpp::executors::SingleThreadedExecutor executor;
```
we attach our node using the `executor.add_node(haikuPublisher)` line, and `executor.spin()` makes it run indefinitely.

Note that we _could_ have put the `HaikuPublisher` class definition, source code, _and_ executable `main()` all inside the `publisher.cpp` file. But the advantage of this structure is that we can make _multiple_ publishers and run them simultaneously:
```
auto haiku1 = std::make_shared<HaikuPublisher>("haiku_publisher_1", "haiku", 1000);
auto haiku2 = std::make_shared<HaikuPublisher>("haiku_publisher_2", "haiku", 2000);
auto haiku3 = std::make_shared<HaikuPublisher>("haiku_publisher_3", "haiku", 3000);

rclcpp::executors::MultiThreadedExecutor executor;
executor.add_node(haiku1);
executor.add_node(haiku2);
executor.add_node(haiku3);
executor.spin();
```
Each publisher can run using its own unique parameters. It also means we can attached _different_ classes to the executor (other publishers, services, action servers, etc.).

### 1.1.4 Create Configuration Files :hammer_and_wrench:

#### The CMake File:

Inside the `tutorial_ros2/CMakeLists.txt` file we need to add:
```
find_package(std_msgs REQUIRED)
```
since we are using the `std_msgs::msg::String` field inside our publisher and subscriber.

We then add these line(s) to actually compile the executable:
```
add_executable(publisher src/publisher.cpp
                         src/HaikuPublisher.cpp)
```
where:
1. We assign the name `publisher` which is what will be known to ROS2 when we want to run the node,
2. Link the `publisher.cpp` _and_ the `HaikuPublisher.cpp` source files.

Then we need to list the dependencies:
```
ament_target_dependencies(publisher
                          "rclcpp"
                          "std_msgs")
```
This says that the `publisher` executable relies on the ROS2 C++ client libraries `rclcpp` (obviously!), and needs the `std_msgs` package within ROS2.
